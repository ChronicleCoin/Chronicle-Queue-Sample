== Downloading and running sample programs

If you're running Windows, you will need to install a `git` client such as Cygwin, https://cygwin.com/install.html[here]

This allows you to install Linux packages that aren't already on Windows.

When this asks you which packages you want to install, search for and add `git`

Next clone this repository in the Cygwin terminal
